# Welcome to SPACE FROG - THE GAME

This web-based game has a hint of nostalgia with a modern day twist. There are a series of challenging levels that will test any gamer old or new.

We where inspired by the game **Frogger** which is a classic arcade game from the 1980s. We have taken the concept of the game and added our own twist to it. The game is designed to be fun and engaging for all ages. The game is designed to be played on a desktop or laptop computer. The game is not designed for mobile devices (but still works on them).

### Testing

Before deploying the game, it's crucial to thoroughly test it to ensure a smooth player experience. Below are the steps for effective testing:

### Functionality Testing:

Verify that all controls (arrow keys, space-bar) work correctly.
Ensure that the frog moves as expected in all directions.
Test collision detection for obstacles, enemies, and pickups.
Confirm that the scoring system and level progression function properly.
Cross-Browser Testing:

Test the game on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) to ensure compatibility.
Check for any layout issues or performance discrepancies across different browsers.
Responsive Design:

Verify that the game scales properly on various screen sizes, including desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
Test touch controls on mobile devices to ensure they work smoothly.
Performance Testing:

Monitor the gameâ€™s performance for any lag, frame drops, or crashes, especially during intense action sequences.
Check memory usage and load times to ensure they are within acceptable limits.
User Experience Testing:

Gather feedback from a group of testers regarding the gameâ€™s difficulty, controls, and overall enjoyment.
Make adjustments based on player feedback to improve the overall experience.

### Edge Case Testing:

Test unusual scenarios, such as pressing multiple keys at once or reaching extreme scores, to ensure the game handles them gracefully.


### Bug Tracking:

Document any bugs or issues discovered during testing.
Fix identified bugs and retest to confirm that they are resolved. *(The only bugs are the fly's that you can eat ðŸ˜œ)*
